# Intro into game development on Solana

The gaming space in the Solana ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Integrating with Solana can provide numerous benefits for games, such as enabling players to own and trade their assets via NFTs in games, building a open and composable in-game economy, creating composable game programs, and allowing players to compete for valuable assets.

Solana is purpose-built for games, with its 400ms block time and lightning-fast confirmations making it a real-time database that's free for all. It's perfect for genres like strategy games, city builders, turn-based games, and more.

However, not everything needs to be put on the blockchain. Smaller integrations using NFTs that represent game items, for example, can be easily done. Transaction fees are extremely cheap, and there are many tools and SDKs available to start building today. You can build your game in [Javascript](https://docs.solana.com/de/developing/clients/javascript-api) and Canvas, [Phaser](https://turbo.computer/), [Turbo Rust](https://turbo.computer/), or use one of the Solana Game SDKs for the three biggest game engines - [UnitySDK](./game-sdks), [UnrealSDK](https://github.com/staratlasmeta/FoundationKit), and [Godot](https://github.com/Virus-Axel/godot-solana-sdk). Find a list of all gaming SDKs here:â€š [Game SDKs](./game-sdks).


# What are the benefits of building games on Solana?

1. No user management: Players can use their Solana wallet to authenticate themselves in the game.
2. No server costs: Solana is a decentralized network, so you don't need to pay for servers.
3. Deploy once and have no running costs for your program. You can even close the program to get the sol back. 
4. Reward players for great achievements or let them play against each other for valuable assets
5. Permissionlessly use all of the other programs deployed on Solana, like decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, highscore program, loyalty or referral program and more.
6. A globally plattform independant payment plattform, not matter if browser, android/ios or any other platform as long as the players can sign a transaction they can buy assets. 
7. Save the 30% fee that Apple and Google take for in app purchases by deploying directly to the [Saga DAPP store](https://docs.solanamobile.com/dapp-publishing/intro).

# There are several ways to integrate Solana into your game:

1. Give players digital collectibles for in-game items or use them as characters. Check out [Nfts in games](/developers/guides/games/nfts-in-games)
2. Use tokens for in-app purchases or micro-payments in the game. See [use tokens](/developers/guides/games/interact-with-tokens)
3. Use the player's wallet to authenticate them in the game. [Solana Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) 
4. Run tournaments and pay out crypto rewards to your players. 
5. Develop the game entirely on-chain to:
    i. Reward your players in every step they take. Start with [Hello world](/developers/guides/games/hello-world.md).
    ii. Allow any game/app/device to connect with your game.
    iii. Enact governance for the game's future.
    iv. Ledger verifiable activity for anti-cheat systems.

With all these benefits, Solana is quickly becoming the go-to platform for game developers. Get started today!
